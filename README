Copyright (c) 1994 Anthony Dekker

NEUQUANT Neural-Net quantization algorithm by Anthony Dekker, 1994.
See "Kohonen neural networks for optimal colour quantization"
in "Network: Computation in Neural Systems" Vol. 5 (1994) pp 351-367.
for a discussion of the algorithm.

Modified to quantize 32bit RGBA images for the pngnq program.
Also modified to accept a numebr of colors arguement.

Rewritten by Kornel Lesinski (2009)
Euclidean distance, color matching dependent on alpha channel 
and with gamma correction. code refreshed for modern compilers/architectures:
ANSI C, floats, removed pointer tricks and used arrays and structs.

Ported from C to Haxe by Nickolay Grebenshikov, http://www.grebenshikov.ru, (2010)
Support 32bit ARGB images.
